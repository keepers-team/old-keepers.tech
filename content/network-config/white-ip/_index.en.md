### What is meant by a «grey» or «white» IP?

Under the «white» IP we mean that you can do a port forwarding to your torrent client. In other words, your torrent
client is reachable from the Internet.
By the «grey» one it is meant that you have no capability to forward the port for the torrent client. It can be due to
various reasons: your ISP gives you only an internal LAN address or you use a VPN that does not support such a feature.
There are various online tools to check port availability and you may try it. Make sure you start the torrent client
first and you use the incoming port from there for the check.
